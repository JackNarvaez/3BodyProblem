# 3BodyProblem

Authors: Narva√©z J.

Simulation of a system of 3 bodies interacting with each other gravitationally. It focuses on the observation of time evolution in Classical Orbital Elements (COEs), trying to detect the Kozai-Lidov Effect.

The evolution step is performed using `PEFRL` integrator, an symplectic algorithm of 4th order.
